# WebEngineering Module, Graded Exercise

## Commit Proposal

Matriculation Number: 17-547-571

Project idea short description: A Calculator app, that works for basic mathematical operations (+, - , *, /). The results are 
going to be saved chronologically into a database, so a history can be created and visualized on the page.


## Project confirmation

Cool! Think about what are you going to save into the database: the whole operation? The result only?

As well, will any user be able to visualize the history? Or are you going to implmenent authentication/authorization? Anyway, start small and extend funtionalities if time permits.

You might start.

Other comments: 

I'm particular proud of:
- The look of the app. I invested a lot of time designing.
- How the history is shown. The app always started with the first calculation already
  done, because the page was rendered after calculating. To fix that I always clear  
  the database when I render the calculating page in the start.
