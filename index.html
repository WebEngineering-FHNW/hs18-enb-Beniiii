        <p>
            First of all, I started by building the base mvc structure of the project by using in course material as template. I got a quite amount of errors in the beginning but managed to fix them.
            After the setup was done, I started creating the logic for the mathematical calculations and continued by integrating this into the view. Then it took me a big load of time to create a proper
            styling with css, so it looks decent.
